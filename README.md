# Welcome! 

I'm Jos√© Luis Aguilar, a Chemical Engineer that has been working as a Tech Consultant recently (though in the past, I've also worked in management consulting).

Here you'll be able to see several of the projects I've been working on while on my free time. 

My most recent project is on [Ecobici](project-ecobike/intro.md), which is still under work.
