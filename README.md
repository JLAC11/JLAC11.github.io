# Intro

I'm Jos√© Luis Aguilar, a Chemical Engineer that has been working as a Tech Consultant recently (though in the past, I've also worked in management consulting).

Here you'll be able to see several of the projects I've been working on while on my free time. 

My most recent project is on [Ecobici](project-ecobike/intro.md), which is still under work.

## Navigation

If you delve into this website, these are the following places to jump into:  
  
- [Ecobici](project-ecobike/intro.md), which is the project I'm working on.
- [My Github page](https://github.com/JLAC11) to see some of the repos I've developed.
- [Personal notes](resources/notes/Matematica/Machine Learning/Machine Learning.md), if you don't mind wandering through them and reading a bit in Spanish. NOTE: I've not tested this and just exported my notes into a markdown format, so I can't make any promises on how this renders.
