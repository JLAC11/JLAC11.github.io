title: "Ecobici at a glance: Intro"
---

This site contains information regarding a brief analysis run on the historical data collected for all trips done in Ecobici (the Mexico City bike sharing system) in the month of May 2025.  

You can find all the related code [in this repository](https://github.com/JLAC11/Ecobici/tree/master)

All analyses shown here will attempt to answer the following questions:

- What patterns can we see in how people use Ecobici?
- What clear relationships can we see in Ecobici users? (Basic relationships between variables)
- How do trips look like in the Ecobici network? (Origin-Destination matrix analysis)
- Is there some clear unsatisifed demand in this network? (Demand analysis integrating the aforementioned topics)


Frankly, I had thought of building a much more formal document than this blog, but given time constraints (as well as just wishing to *not* sit for hours at a time doing this), I've decided to go into a more atomic format, sharing over here every once in a while small advances.
Given this, you can start looking at the [data at a first glance](a-first-glance.md)
